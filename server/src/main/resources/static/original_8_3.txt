[S2] Updated <p class = 'c6'> 5 / 5 / 2010 1 : 41 PM </p>
[S3] <p class = 'c0'> Riots </p> over harsh new austerity <p class = 'c2'> measures </p> left three bank <p class = 'c5'> workers </p> <p class = 'c0'> dead </p> and <p class = 'c0'> engulfed </p> <p class = 'c1'> the streets of Athens </p> on <p class = 'c6'> Wednesday </p> , as angry <p class = 'c5'> protesters </p> <p class = 'c0'> tried </p> to <p class = 'c0'> storm </p> <p class = 'c1'> parliament </p> , <p class = 'c0'> hurled </p> <p class = 'c2'> Molotov cocktails </p> at <p class = 'c3'> police </p> and <p class = 'c0'> torched </p> <p class = 'c2'> buildings </p> .
[S4] <p class = 'c3'> Police </p> <p class = 'c0'> responded </p> with barrages of <p class = 'c2'> tear gas </p> .
[S5] Tens of thousands of <p class = 'c5'> people </p> <p class = 'c0'> took to </p> <p class = 'c1'> the streets </p> in a nationwide <p class = 'c0'> strike </p> to <p class = 'c0'> protest </p> new <p class = 'c2'> taxes </p> and government spending <p class = 'c0'> cuts </p> <p class = 'c0'> demanded </p> by the <p class = 'c3'> International Monetary Fund </p> and other European <p class = 'c4'> nations </p> before heavily indebted <p class = 'c4'> Greece </p> <p class = 'c0'> gets </p> a euro110 billion ( $ 141 billion ) <p class = 'c2'> loan package </p> to <p class = 'c0'> keep </p> it from <p class = 'c0'> defaulting </p> .
[S6] The three bank <p class = 'c5'> workers </p> a <p class = 'c5'> man </p> and two <p class = 'c5'> women </p> <p class = 'c0'> died </p> after <p class = 'c5'> demonstrators </p> <p class = 'c0'> set their <p class = 'c1'> bank </p> on fire </p> along <p class = 'c1'> the main demonstration route in central Athens </p> .
[S7] As their colleagues sobbed in the street , five other bank workers were rescued from the balcony of the burning building .
[S8] " A demonstration is one thing and murder is quite another ! " Prime Minister George Papandreou thundered in Parliament during a session to discuss the spending cuts he announced Sunday measures even the IMF has called draconian .
[S9] Lawmakers held a minute of silence for the dead the first deaths during a protest in Greece since 1991 .
[S10] " We are all concerned by Greece 's economic and budgetary situation but at this time our thoughts are with the human victims in Athens , " European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said in Brussels .
[S11] A senior fire department official said demonstrators prevented firefighters from reaching the burning building , costing them vital time .
[S12] " Several crucial minutes were lost , " the official said , visibly upset .
[S13] " If we had intervened earlier , the loss of life could have been prevented . "
[S14] He asked not to be identified pending an official announcement .
[S15] In Berlin , German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the Greek bailout critical for all of Europe .
[S16] " Nothing less than the future of Europe , and with that the future of Germany in Europe , is at stake , " Merkel told lawmakers in Berlin , urging them to quickly pass the country 's share of the bailout euro22 billion ( $ 28 billion ) over three years by Friday .
[S17] " We are at a fork in the road . "
[S18] Greece faces a May 19 due date on debt it says it ca n't repay without the help .
[S19] In Brussels , European Union officials desperately tried to calm market fears that Greece 's debt crisis was spreading to the rest of Europe , insisting it was a " unique case " combining profligacy and tampered accounts .
[S20] Van Rompuy insisted the growing debt problems in Spain and Portugal had " absolutely nothing to do with the situation in Greece . "
[S21] " Greece is a unique and particular case in the EU " because of its " precarious debt dynamics " and because it " has cheated with its statistics for years and years , " EU Commissioner Olli Rehn said .
[S22] But Moody 's Investor Services , a major ratings agency , put Portugal 's bond rating on review for possible downgrade Wednesday .
[S23] Spanish and Portuguese bonds and stocks slumped further on the news , reflecting fears that they may also have trouble repaying their debt and that the eurozone would have to extend even larger bailouts to them .
[S24] <p class = 'c1'> On the streets of Athens </p> , <p class = 'c5'> demonstrators </p> <p class = 'c0'> chanted </p> <p class = 'c4'> " Thieves </p> , <p class = 'c4'> thieves </p> ! " as <p class = 'c5'> they </p> <p class = 'c0'> attempted </p> to <p class = 'c0'> break through </p> a riot police <p class = 'c2'> cordon </p> <p class = 'c0'> guarding </p> <p class = 'c1'> Parliament </p> and <p class = 'c0'> chased </p> ceremonial <p class = 'c5'> guards </p> away from <p class = 'c1'> the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the building </p> .
[S25] <p class = 'c2'> Tear gas </p> <p class = 'c0'> drifted </p> across <p class = 'c1'> the city center </p> as <p class = 'c5'> rioters </p> <p class = 'c0'> hurled </p> paving <p class = 'c2'> stones </p> and fire <p class = 'c2'> bombs </p> at <p class = 'c3'> police </p> .
[S26] <p class = 'c5'> Firefighters </p> <p class = 'c0'> extinguished </p> <p class = 'c0'> blazes </p> at least two <p class = 'c1'> buildings </p> <p class = 'c1'> the bank </p> and <p class = 'c1'> a branch of the Finance Ministry </p> while <p class = 'c5'> protesters </p> <p class = 'c0'> set up </p> <p class = 'c0'> burning </p> <p class = 'c2'> barricades </p> and <p class = 'c0'> torched </p> <p class = 'c2'> cars </p> and a fire <p class = 'c2'> truck </p> .
[S27] <p class = 'c3'> Police </p> <p class = 'c0'> said </p> 12 <p class = 'c5'> people </p> were <p class = 'c0'> injured </p> in the <p class = 'c0'> riots </p> .
[S28] The marches came amid a 24 - hour nationwide general strike that grounded all flights to and from Greece , shut down ports , schools and government services , and left hospitals working with emergency medical staff .
[S29] The Acropolis and all other ancient sites were closed and journalists also walked off the job , suspending television and radio news broadcasts .
[S30] But media later broke the strike to report on the deaths and the protests .
[S31] <p class = 'c0'> Violence </p> also <p class = 'c0'> broke out </p> in <p class = 'c1'> the northern city of Thessaloniki </p> , where another 20 , 000 <p class = 'c5'> people </p> <p class = 'c0'> marched </p> through <p class = 'c1'> the city center </p> and some <p class = 'c5'> youths </p> <p class = 'c0'> smashed </p> store <p class = 'c2'> windows </p> .
[S32] Union reaction over austerity measures until now had been relatively muted by Greece 's volatile standards , despite several previous strikes .
[S33] But anger mounted after Papandreou announced cuts in salaries and pensions for civil servants and another round of consumer tax increases .
[S34] Papandreou said he has no choice but to implement the measures if Greece was to avoid bankruptcy .
[S35] " There was only one other solution for the country to default , taking the citizenry with it .
[S36] And that would not have affected the rich , it would have affected workers and pensioners , " he told Parliament on Wednesday .
[S37] " That was a real possibility , however nightmarish . "
[S38] Under the bailout package , Greece will receive loans over three years from the IMF and the other 15 countries who share the euro currency .
[S39] The rescue aims to prevent Athens ' debt troubles from becoming a wider crisis for the euro .
[S40] But the rioting underlined skepticism that the Greek government could keep up its end of the bargain , helping drive the euro below $ 1 . 29 for the first time in over a year .
[S41] Even with the bailout , many economists think Greece will eventually default on or restructure its debts because its prospects for economic growth are so poor over the next several years , hurting government revenue .
[S42] Some fear the austerity measures insisted upon by the EU and IMF could make prospects for growth even worse .
[S43] Unions say low - income Greeks will suffer disproportionately from the latest austerity measures , which aim to save euro30 billion ( $ 40 billion ) the country 's current budget deficit through 2012 .
[S44] " These people are losing their rights , they are losing their future , " said Yiannis Panagopoulos , head of GSEE , one of the two largest unions .
[S45] " The country can not surrender without a fight . "
[S46] IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the crisis could spread to other countries despite the rescue package 's efforts to contain it .
[S47] " Everyone must remain extremely vigilant " to this risk , Strauss - Kahn said in an interview in French newspaper Le Parisien Wednesday .
[S48] " I completely understand the Greek population 's anger , its incomprehension at the size of the economic catastrophe , " Strauss - Kahn said .
[S49] But , he said , Greeks must also understand that without these measures " the situation would be infinitely more serious . "
[S50] The draft bill of the new austerity measures is to be voted on Thursday .
[S51] Papandreou 's Socialists hold a comfortable majority of 160 in the 300 - seat Parliament and the bill is expected to pass easily .

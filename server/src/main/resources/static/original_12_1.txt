[S3] The Indian <p class = 'c3'> Navy </p> <p class = 'c0'> patrolling </p> <p class = 'c1'> the Gulf of Aden </p> on <p class = 'c6'> Thursday </p> <p class = 'c0'> thwarted </p> a multi - boat <p class = 'c0'> attack </p> by sea <p class = 'c5'> brigands </p> on merchant <p class = 'c4'> vessels </p> , <p class = 'c0'> apprehending </p> 26 Somali <p class = 'c5'> pirates </p> and <p class = 'c0'> confiscating </p> <p class = 'c2'> arms </p> and <p class = 'c2'> ammunition </p> , in the fifth successful anti - piracy <p class = 'c0'> operation </p> since <p class = 'c6'> September </p> .
[S4] At 9 . 25 a . m . on Thursday , navy personnel aboard warship INS Sukanya spotted a group of five suspicious boats speedily approaching the merchant vessels of her group .
[S5] “ The warship immediately altered ( its direction ) towards the suspicious vessels and challenged them .
[S6] On seeing the resolve evident in the warship ’ s action and probably mindful of the reputation for resolute action that the Indian Navy justly enjoys in such deployments , the pirate skiffs reversed course and tried to flee the area , ” Captain Manohar Nambiar , Chief Public Relations Officer , Defence , said .
[S7] While <p class = 'c2'> two </p> of them managed to <p class = 'c0'> escape </p> , <p class = 'c4'> INS Sukanya </p> successfully <p class = 'c0'> intercepted </p> the remaining three <p class = 'c2'> boats </p> and , in a well - practiced and professionally <p class = 'c0'> executed </p> boarding - and - search <p class = 'c0'> action </p> , <p class = 'c0'> nabbed </p> 26 Somali <p class = 'c5'> pirates </p> with six AK 47 <p class = 'c2'> rifles </p> , 12 <p class = 'c2'> magazines </p> and about 300 <p class = 'c2'> rounds of ammunition </p> .
[S8] This is the fifth successful anti - piracy operation conducted by INS Sukanya in the course of her ongoing patrol mission in the Gulf of Aden that commenced in September , the Navy said .
[S9] INS Sukanya , currently deployed on anti - piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden under the operational control of the Western Naval Command , was escorting a group of five merchant vessels through the Internationally Recognised Transit Corridor when the incident happened .
[S10] The timely operation by INS Sukanya resulted , once again , in foiling the pirates ’ attempt to attack merchant vessels transiting the busy sea lane through which over nearly $ 100 billion worth India ’ s external trade passes each year , Captain Nambiar said .
[S11] In their five operations so far , the personnel on board the warship have confiscated 14 AK - 47 Rifles , 31 magazines and 923 rounds of ammunition , he said .
[S12] Indian Navy is part of the international effort to ensure the safety and freedom of seaborne trade in this high - risk stronghold of modern - day piracy .

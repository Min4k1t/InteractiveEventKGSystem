[S5] Cheeks , who was fired March 2 as head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers , is the fourth head coach since King took over as the team 's president and general manager on May 26 , 2003 .
[S6] That is the same date that Larry Brown resigned from the Sixers after six seasons , the last time coaching stability existed with the team .
[S7] Cheeks was a second - round draft choice of the 76ers in 1978 and played for 11 seasons with the team .
[S8] He was the point guard and floor leader of the Sixers ' 1983 NBA title team .
[S9] At a news conference last night at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine , King said he had the support of Ed Snider , the chairman of Comcast - Spectacor , the team 's owner , for his latest moves even though the Sixers will be paying ex - coaches Randy Ayers ( $ 2 million ) and O'Brien along with Cheeks next season .
[S10] " In talking with Ed , we felt the main focus was that we want to make the right decisions and not let money be the factor , " King said .
[S11] " We think we owe it to our fans and the city of Philadelphia to do that . "
[S12] Cheeks , 48 , a four - time NBA all - star while with the Sixers , was fired from the Blazers , his first head coaching job , in the middle of his fourth season .
[S13] He led the team to a 162 - 139 record .
[S14] Two years ago , after Brown resigned , King looked to Cheeks to take over as Brown 's successor .
[S15] But the Trail Blazers rebuffed him three times , because Cheeks was still under contract to them .
[S16] The Sixers then hired Ayers , who lasted 52 games before being replaced by Chris Ford .
[S17] <p class = 'c4'> King </p> <p class = 'c0'> said </p> <p class = 'c4'> he </p> <p class = 'c0'> decided </p> on <p class = 'c5'> Saturday </p> to <p class = 'c0'> fire </p> <p class = 'c4'> O'Brien </p> , and then <p class = 'c0'> checked </p> with <p class = 'c4'> Cheeks </p> to <p class = 'c0'> see </p> if <p class = 'c4'> he 'd </p> be <p class = 'c0'> interested </p> in the <p class = 'c0'> job </p> .
[S18] <p class = 'c4'> Cheeks </p> <p class = 'c0'> said </p> <p class = 'c4'> he </p> would be , and <p class = 'c4'> King </p> <p class = 'c0'> called </p> <p class = 'c4'> him </p> again <p class = 'c5'> yesterday </p> and <p class = 'c0'> reached </p> a <p class = 'c1'> deal </p> after <p class = 'c0'> notifying </p> <p class = 'c4'> O'Brien </p> of <p class = 'c4'> his </p> <p class = 'c0'> decision </p> .
[S19] Terms of the deal were not disclosed .
[S20] When King hired O'Brien , he had called him a " perfect fit " for the job .
[S21] O'Brien did lead the Sixers to a 43 - 39 record - a 10 - win improvement over the previous season - and a playoff berth and coached Allen Iverson to his fourth NBA scoring title .
[S22] But in evaluating the season , King said he did n't think the Sixers were heading in the right direction .
[S23] He had a problem with the team 's style of play , which included reliance on the three - point basket and a defense that protected the paint but had trouble getting out on perimeter shooters .
[S24] There was also talk that O'Brien was aloof and not communicative with his players .
[S25] He did not start Samuel Dalembert , a developing young center , until the season 's 19th game , and he did not play Willie Green with Iverson for much of the season 's final four months because he felt that was a bad matchup defensively .
[S26] King said that in his postseason meetings with players , " not one of them said they would n't play for Jim . . .
[S27] that they 'd all come back ready to go and try to go further in the playoffs . "
[S28] But other things bothered him .
[S29] King said he did n't want to make a snap decision when the season ended on May 3 , the day that the Detroit Pistons eliminated the Sixers from the playoffs .
[S30] He talked to his management team , went on vacation for a week , then made his decision on Saturday .
[S31] " In the interview process with Jim , there were a lot of things that we talked about , " King said .
[S32] " But in watching the season , evaluating our young players ' development and evaluating our style of play , it was n't something I was comfortable with . "
[S33] Reached by telephone yesterday , O'Brien declined to comment .
[S34] " I 'm not going to have any discussion about this , " he said .
[S35] <p class = 'c4'> King </p> <p class = 'c0'> said </p> that when <p class = 'c4'> he </p> <p class = 'c0'> broke </p> the <p class = 'c0'> news </p> <p class = 'c5'> yesterday </p> to <p class = 'c4'> O'Brien </p> , <p class = 'c4'> " He </p> <p class = 'c0'> asked </p> why , and <p class = 'c4'> I </p> <p class = 'c0'> told </p> <p class = 'c4'> him </p> that <p class = 'c4'> I </p> just <p class = 'c0'> felt </p> there were some <p class = 'c1'> things </p> that <p class = 'c0'> took place </p> that <p class = 'c4'> I </p> do n't <p class = 'c0'> think </p> will <p class = 'c0'> change </p> and <p class = 'c3'> we 're </p> <p class = 'c0'> going </p> to make a <p class = 'c0'> change </p> .
[S36] He said , ' Thank you . ' "
[S37] Snider , who attended King 's news conference , said he backed King .
[S38] " I really do n't question Billy at all , " he said .
[S39] " I know what went on in the process when he made this decision , as well as the decision to hire Jim O'Brien .
[S40] I 've supported his moves , and I still do . "
[S41] O'Brien was excited to come back to Philadelphia because of his roots in the city .
[S42] Cheeks , who is expected to speak at a press conference today , is excited to be coming back to Philadelphia because of all the success he enjoyed here as a player , followed by seven seasons as an assistant coach .
[S43] " Mo is family , " King said .
[S44] " Mo bleeds 76ers .
[S45] He bleeds Philadelphia . "
[S46] He is still the franchise 's all - time leader in assists and steals .
[S47] Cheeks also played with San Antonio , New York , Atlanta and New Jersey before retiring in 1993 .
[S48] Cheeks returned to the Sixers in 1994 as an assistant coach and stayed for seven seasons until the Trail Blazers hired him as head coach on June 27 , 2001 .
[S49] Under Cheeks ' guidance , the Blazers made the playoffs in 2002 and 2003 , but did not get out of the first round .
[S50] They missed the postseason in 2004 , breaking a streak of 21 consecutive years in the playoffs , and were wracked by dissension .
[S51] " I look at Mo Cheeks and I know Mo Cheeks , " King said .
[S52] " If players have problems with Mo Cheeks , then there 's got to be something wrong with those players . "
[S53] Under O'Brien , the former head coach of the Boston Celtics , Iverson moved from shooting guard to point guard and responded with an MVP - caliber season , winning his fourth NBA scoring title .
[S54] But <p class = 'c4'> O'Brien </p> is <p class = 'c0'> gone </p> now .
[S55] <p class = 'c4'> Cheeks </p> is <p class = 'c0'> in </p> .
[S56] And King knows he 's being held accountable .
[S57] " I look in the mirror every day , " King said .
[S58] " I 'm not somebody that 's above scrutiny , but I think I try to do the best I can and make the best decisions . "

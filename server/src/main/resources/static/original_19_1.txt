[S3] Hostility has been mounting this week in East Flatbush , Brooklyn , after two plainclothes police officers fatally shot 16 - year - old Kimani Gray after he allegedly pointed a revolver at them on Saturday night .
[S4] On <p class = 'c3'> Monday </p> a group of about 130 <p class = 'c2'> people </p> were <p class = 'c0'> marching </p> <p class = 'c1'> toward the 67th Police Precinct station </p> when about two dozen young <p class = 'c2'> protesters </p> <p class = 'c0'> splintered off </p> — <p class = 'c0'> drawing </p> <p class = 'c2'> riot police </p> — and <p class = 'c0'> trashed </p> a <p class = 'c1'> Rite Aid </p> .
[S5] <p class = 'c3'> Tuesday </p> the <p class = 'c2'> crowd </p> was mostly <p class = 'c0'> calm </p> , but on <p class = 'c3'> Wednesday </p> — the same day <p class = 'c2'> Gray 's </p> <p class = 'c0'> autopsy </p> <p class = 'c0'> showed </p> <p class = 'c2'> he </p> had been <p class = 'c0'> shot </p> seven times — part of the 200 person <p class = 'c2'> crowd </p> became <p class = 'c0'> unruly </p> .
[S6] The night began with hope that Gray 's mother would speak at a vigil alongside mothers of local shooting victims , but the night turned when about 30 young men showed up in the shadows across the street .
[S7] " They were staying in the dark area of the street , " a witness told CNN .
[S8] " You just knew it was going to turn into the cops trying to contain those kids who were obviously gon na go for it .
[S9] That just stopped the original intention of the night . "
[S10] The witness said the teenagers suddenly took off , fanning through streets and side streets , followed by the sound of glass breaking and metal store - front gates being pulled down .
[S11] Protesters began throwing bricks and bottles while cops began pepper - spraying and arresting .
[S12] By the end an officer 's face and the window of a police van had been hit with bricks , and 46 people had been arrested .
[S13] The string of incidents has amplified the distrustful friction between the neighborhood 's informal crews of armed teenagers and its aggressive police , whom residents say make prejudiced decisions based on race .
[S14] Kenneth J . Montgomery , an attorney for the Gray family , told the LA Times that the police " patrol these neighborhoods like they ’ re paramilitary . ”
[S15] “ [ The police ] have a hard time because there ’ s a lot of crime in the neighborhood , ” a local barber told The New York Times .
[S16] “ But when they play hardball , they end up going after innocent people , too . ”
[S17] Police say that on Saturday around 11 : 30 p . m . Kimani Gray was standing outside his home with five other young men before splitting off when he noticed two plainclothes officers in an unmarked car .
[S18] After he " adjusted his waistband and continued to act in a suspicious manner , ” officials say the cops got out of their car and approached Gray — who allegedly turned toward them with a loaded . 38 - caliber revolver in hand .
[S19] The 30 - year - old sergeant and 26 - year - old fired 11 shots — the autopsy showed that seven bullets entered Gray 's body , three of them from the rear .
[S20] A revolver loaded with four bullets was reportedly recovered from the scene .
[S21] Police commissioner Raymond Kelly told the New York Times there was “ nothing to indicate that this shooting was outside the guidelines ” while John C . Cerar , the former commander for firearms training at the Police Department , said " it appears to be a good shooting ” under the reported circumstances .
[S22] That statement does n't pacify neighborhood residents , who question the official story — some in the community do n't believe Gray had a gun — and perceive the officers ' behavior as part of a larger trend of NYPD antagonism .
[S23] “ We ’ re talking about a powder keg out here .
[S24] Any incident could trigger it , ” City Councilman Charles Barron told the LA Times .
[S25] On Wednesday tensions " seemed to be decreasing until Mahnefah Gray , sister of the teen killed by police , was arrested while crossing the street , " according to Danny Gold of Metropolis .
